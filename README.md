# CPlusPlusProgram


This project was created to sort through and tally data for a grocery store. It succeeds in counting the number of times each item is purchased and outputting a histogram for the amounts. It utilizes C++ and Python which is linked in the function calls. This program could work better and would be more clean if it eliminated duplicate items and just displayed the number of times each item was purchased. Instead, it currently outputs all items in the order it was purchased. The most challenging part was integrating Python and C++ effectively on my home computer. It was a challenge to complete the portion in a different IDE. To overcome this, I used a tutorial online and was able to successfully integrate different programming languages. I now have the resources and documentation to replicate this process in other projects. This program should easily be able to grow and handle various lists of data. It will be simple to update to complete new tasks because the code is written clearly using industry standard best practices and commented throughout the program to highlight certain decisions. This should make the code adaptable and useful in the future.
